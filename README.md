#### Syllabus

Here is a suggested schedule. Typically, the information in the first five
chapters needs to be covered, along with a focus on any one or all of the
remaining six chapters.

```shell
make schedule
```

#### TODO

- [X] compile this doc to generate schedule
- [ ] integrate with calcurse
